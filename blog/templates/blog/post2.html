		<h2><a	href="post_list.html">STUDY HACKS</a></h2>
		<p>As The Beatles once said in one of their best songs Money
		(That’s What I Want): “The best things in life are free, but your lovin’ don’t pay my bills.”
		As a student, one of the most important things to keep in mind is the amount of money you spend 
		during your study years. Spend too much, and you risk accumulating too much debt after graduation; 
		spend too little and you might be left wondering what the point of it all was, if you didn’t even get 
		to have any fun or new experiences</p>
		
		
		<h3>Give yourself enough time to study </h3>
		</p>Don't leave it until the last minute. While some students 
		do seem to thrive on last-minute cramming, it's widely accepted that (for most of us) this is not the 
		best way to approach an exam. To help sort out your time management, set up a timetable for your study. 
		Write down how many exams you have and the days on which you have to sit them. Then organize your study accordingly. 
		You may want to give some exams more study time than others, so find a balance that you feel comfortable with. </p>
		
		<h3>Organize your study space </h3>
		<p>Make sure you have enough space to spread your textbooks and notes out. Have you got enough light? Is your chair
		comfortable? Are your computer games out of sight?Try and get rid of all distractions, and make 
		sure you feel as comfortable and able to focus as possible. For some people, this may mean almost complete silence, 
		for others, background music helps. Some of us need everything completely tidy and organized in order to concentrate, 
		while others thrive in a more cluttered environment. Think about what works for you, and take the time to get it right.</p>
		
		<h3>Use flow charts and diagrams </h3>
        <p>Visual aids can be really helpful when revising. At the start of a topic, challenge yourself to write down everything 
		you already know about a topic - and then highlight where the gaps lie. Closer to the exam, condense your revision notes
		into one-page diagrams. Getting your ideas down in this brief format can then help you to quickly recall everything you 
		need to know during the exam.<p>

        <h3>Practice on old exams</h3>
		<p>One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you get used to
		the format of the questions, and - if you time yourself - can also be good practice for making sure you spend the righ
		t amount of time on each section.</p>
