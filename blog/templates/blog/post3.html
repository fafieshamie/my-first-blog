			<p>Despite the fact that many students know that proper nutrition is important not only for their health
			but also for their brain, not all of them are able to lead a healthy lifestyle in college. This blog can become
			an inspiration for those who want to maintain a healthy diet but struggle with it. It doesnâ€™t overload you with 
			numerous fitness facts you probably already know, providing motivation instead as well as gentle reminders about 
			why it is so important to start taking care of your health as early as possible.</P>
